# Hey, I'm Gordon 👋  

🎓 I’m a student at **Brown University**, studying Applied Math–Computer Science.  
💡 I’m really into **AI, cloud computing, and building cool stuff** that helps people — from space engineering projects to healthcare apps.  
🎸 When I’m not coding, I’m probably **playing guitar with my band** (we even built our own website and sold merch — DIY style).
